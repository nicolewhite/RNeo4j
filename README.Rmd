# RNeo4j [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nicolewhite/RNeo4j.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nicolewhite/RNeo4j)

RNeo4j is Neo4j's R driver. It allows you to read and write data from / to Neo4j directly from your R environment.

## <a name="#install"></a>Install

### Neo4j

First and foremost, [download Neo4j](http://neo4j.com/download/other-releases/)!

#### Windows

If you're on Windows, download the `.exe` and follow the instructions. You'll get a GUI where you simply press "Start" to start Neo4j.

#### OS X

If you're on OS X, you can download either the `.dmg` or the `.tar.gz`. The `.dmg` will give you a GUI where you simply press "Start" to start Neo4j. Otherwise, download the `.tar.gz`, unzip, navigate to the directory and execute `./bin/neo4j start`.

#### Linux

If you're on Linux, you have to use the `.tar.gz`. Download the `.tar.gz`, unzip, navigate to the directory and execute `./bin/neo4j start`.

### Bolt dependencies

These depencies are are only required if you want to use the Bolt interface.
They must be present at build time, and `libneo4j-client` must also be present at runtime.

#### Windows

- Rust: https://rustup.rs
- Clang: binary releases are available at http://releases.llvm.org/download.html
- libneo4j-client:
    - Make sure you have RTools installed (necessary for building R packages on Windows)
    - Open your MinGW shell (check in start menu, `C:\RTools\mingw_64`, `C:\RTools\mingw_32`, `C:\MinGW\bin`, and `C:\MinGW\1.0\bin`)
    - See "Installing libneo4j-from source" section

#### OS X (with Homebrew installed)

- Rust: `brew install rust` (or https://rustup.rs but see "Rust Path" section)
- Clang: `brew install llvm`
- libneo4j-client: `brew install cleishm/neo4j/libneo4j-client`

#### Linux

- Rust:
    - Debian based (e.g. Mint, Ubuntu): `sudo apt-get install cargo`
    - Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S rust`
    - Building from source: https://rustup.rs but see "Rust Path" section
- Clang: get it from your package manager
    - Debian based (e.g. Mint, Ubuntu): `sudo apt-get install clang libclang-dev`
    - Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S clang`
    - Other: your package manager almost certainly has `clang`. It may be called `llvm`.
- libneo4j-client:
    - Debian based: `sudo apt-get install libneo4j-client-dev`
    - Other: See "Installing libneo4j-client from source"

#### Rust Path

By default, on *nix systems (such as Linux and OS X), rustup only sets the PATH in your shell.
That means that if you try to build RNeo4j in a GUI application like RStudio, it may fail.
To work around this issue, simply build RNeo4j in a terminal.


### RNeo4j

#### From CRAN

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("RNeo4j")
```

#### From GitHub

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("nicolewhite/RNeo4j")
```

#### From Source

Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/nicolewhite/RNeo4j/releases/latest) and download the source code. You can then install with `install.packages`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("/path/to/file.tar.gz", repos=NULL, type="source")
```

#### Load the Package

```{r}
library(RNeo4j)
```

## <a name="#connect"></a>Connect

```{r, eval=FALSE}
graph = startGraph("http://localhost:7474/db/data/")
```

If you have authentication enabled, pass your username and password.

```{r}
graph = startGraph("http://localhost:7474/db/data/", username="neo4j", password="password")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
clear(graph, input=F)
```

## <a name="#nodes"></a>Nodes

```{r}
nicole = createNode(graph, "Person", name="Nicole", age=24)
greta = createNode(graph, "Person", name="Greta", age=24)
kenny = createNode(graph, "Person", name="Kenny", age=27)
shannon = createNode(graph, "Person", name="Shannon", age=23)
```

## <a name="#relationships"></a>Relationships

```{r}
r1 = createRel(greta, "LIKES", nicole, weight=7)
r2 = createRel(nicole, "LIKES", kenny, weight=1)
r3 = createRel(kenny, "LIKES", shannon, weight=3)
r4 = createRel(nicole, "LIKES", shannon, weight=5)
```

## <a name="#cypher"></a>Cypher

If you're returning tabular results, use `cypher`, which will give you a `data.frame`.

```{r}
query = "
MATCH (nicole:Person)-[r:LIKES]->(p:Person)
WHERE nicole.name = 'Nicole'
RETURN nicole.name, r.weight, p.name
"

cypher(graph, query)
```

For anything more complicated, use `cypherToList`, which will give you a `list`.

```{r}
query = "
MATCH (nicole:Person)-[:LIKES]->(p:Person)
WHERE nicole.name = 'Nicole'
RETURN nicole, COLLECT(p.name) AS friends
"

cypherToList(graph, query)
```

Both `cypher` and `cypherToList` accept parameters. These parameters can be passed individually or as a list.

```{r}
query = "
MATCH (p1:Person)-[r:LIKES]->(p2:Person)
WHERE p1.name = {name1} AND p2.name = {name2}
RETURN p1.name, r.weight, p2.name
"

cypher(graph, query, name1="Nicole", name2="Shannon")
cypher(graph, query, list(name1="Nicole", name2="Shannon"))
```

## <a name="#shortest-paths"></a>Shortest Paths

```{r}
p = shortestPath(greta, "LIKES", shannon, max_depth=4)
n = nodes(p)
sapply(n, "[[", "name")
```

## <a name="#weighted-shortest-paths"></a>Weighted Shortest Paths

```{r}
p = shortestPath(greta, "LIKES", shannon, max_depth=4, cost_property="weight")
n = nodes(p)
sapply(n, "[[", "name")
p$weight
```

## <a name="#cypher"></a>Graph Algorithms

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(igraph)

query = "
MATCH (n)-->(m)
RETURN n.name, m.name
"

edgelist = cypher(graph, query)
ig = graph.data.frame(edgelist, directed=F)

betweenness(ig)
closeness(ig)
```

## <a name="#visualizations"></a>Visualizations

### `igraph`

```{r, message=FALSE}
plot(ig)
```

### `ggnet`

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(network)
library(GGally)

net = network(edgelist)
ggnet(net, label.nodes=TRUE)
```

### `visNetwork`

## <a name="#connection-issues"></a>Connection Issues

### Couldn't connect to server
```
Error in curl::curl_fetch_memory(url, handle = handle) : 
  Couldn't connect to server
```

Neo4j probably isn't running. Make sure Neo4j is running first. It's also possible you have localhost resolution issues; try connecting to `http://127.0.0.1:7474/db/data/` instead.

### No authorization header supplied

```
Error: client error: (401) Unauthorized
Neo.ClientError.Security.AuthorizationFailed
No authorization header supplied.
```

You have auth enabled on Neo4j and either didn't provide your username and password or they were invalid. You can pass a username and password to `startGraph`.

```
graph = startGraph("http://localhost:7474/db/data/", username="neo4j", password="password")
```

You can also disable auth by editing the following line in `conf/neo4j-server.properties`.

```
# Require (or disable the requirement of) auth to access Neo4j
dbms.security.auth_enabled=false
```
