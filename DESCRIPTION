Description: Neo4j, a graph database, allows users to store their data as a
    property graph. A graph consists of nodes that are connected by relationships;
    both nodes and relationships can have properties, or key-value pairs. RNeo4j
    is Neo4j's R driver. It allows users to read and write data from and to Neo4j
    directly from their R environment by exposing an interface for interacting with
    nodes, relationships, paths, and more. Most notably, it allows users to retrieve
    Cypher query results as R data frames, where Cypher is Neo4j's graph query
    language. Visit <http://www.neo4j.com> to learn more about Neo4j.
