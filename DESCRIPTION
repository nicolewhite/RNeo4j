Description: 'Neo4j', a graph database, allows users to store their data as a
    property graph. A graph consists of nodes that are connected by relationships;
    both nodes and relationships can have properties, or key-value pairs. 'RNeo4j'
    is the 'Neo4j' R driver. It allows users to read and write data from and to 'Neo4j'
    directly from their R environment by exposing an interface for interacting with
    nodes, relationships, paths, and more. Most notably, it allows users to retrieve
    'Cypher' query results as R data frames, where 'Cypher' is the 'Neo4j' graph query
    language. Visit <http://www.neo4j.com> to learn more about 'Neo4j'.
