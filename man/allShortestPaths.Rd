\title{Shortest Paths and Weighted Shortest Paths}
\usage{
allShortestPaths(fromNode, relType, toNode, direction = "out",
  max_depth = 1, cost_property = character())
}
\arguments{
\item{fromNode}{A node object.}

\item{relType}{A character string. The relationship type to traverse.}

\item{toNode}{A node object.}

\item{direction}{A character string. The relationship direction to traverse; this can be either "in", "out", or "all".}

\item{max_depth}{An integer. The maximum depth of the path.}

\item{cost_property}{A character string. If retrieving a weighted shortest path, the name of the relationship property that contains the weights.}
}
\value{
A list of path objects.
}
\description{
Retrieve all the shortest paths between two nodes.
